Description: A collection of functions for working with longitudinal (i.e., multilevel) data in the social sciences. Includes functions for calculating ICCs and descriptive statistics, centering level-1 variables, and examining missing data. Designed for interval-contingent daily diary and longitudinal designs with two levels, but with some functionality for other research designs (e.g., persons nested in groups, ecological momentary assessment). This package is intended as a compliment to popular packages used for analyzing multilevel data (e.g., 'lme4', 'nlme').
